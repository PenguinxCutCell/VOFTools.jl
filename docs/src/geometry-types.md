# [Geometry Types](@id geometry-types)

The package works around two mutable geometry containers.

## 2D

`Polygon2D` stores polygon vertices and indexing metadata used by 2D truncation
and area routines.

## 3D

`Polyhedron3D` stores vertices, face-to-vertex connectivity, face normals, and
mesh counters used by 3D truncation and volume routines.

See [Reference](@ref reference) for full docstrings.
